# dp-download-service

An ONS service used to either redirect requests to public-accessible links or stream decrypt non public-accessible links

### Installation

Service is authenticated against zebedee, one can run [dp-auth-api-stub](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-auth-api-stub) to mimic service identity check in zebedee.

#### Vault

- Run `brew install vault`
- Run `vault server -dev`

#### AWS credentials

The app uses the default provider chain. When running locally this typically means they are provided by the `~/.aws/credentials` file.  Alternatively you can inject the credentials via environment variables as described in the configuration section

### Healthcheck

The endpoint `/healthcheck` checks the health of vault and the dataset api and returns one of:

- success (200, JSON "status": "OK")
- failure (500, JSON "status": "error").
