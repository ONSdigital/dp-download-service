# DP Download Service

## Introduction

The Download Service is part of the [Static Files System](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-static-files-compose).
This service is responsible for storing the metadata and state of files.

The service uses the [Files API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-files-api) to retrieve a files metadata, whether it
is web or publishing mode and the users role to work out how it should respond to the request to download a file.

If the download service is in publishing mode and the user is allowed to review a file then the file is viewable at any
time as long as the file state is not CREATED (File is still being uploaded)

In web mode the services respond differently depending on the state of the file. The table below show the HTTP response
for each state and why the Download Service responds in such a way.

| context                      | State       | HTTP Response           | Notes                                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| any                          | CREATED     | 404 - Not Found         | File is being uploaded do not expose file exists to public |
| auth user in publishing mode | UPLOADED    | 200 - OK                | File is previewable - stream content from S3     |
| web (anon) user in web mode  | UPLOADED    | 404 - Not Found         | File is being reviewed do not expose file exists to public |
| any                          | PUBLISHED   | 200 - OK                | File is published - stream content from S3       |

## Installation

Service is authenticated against zebedee, one can run [dp-auth-api-stub](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-auth-api-stub)
to mimic service identity check in zebedee.

### AWS credentials

The app uses the default provider chain. When running locally this typically means they are provided by
the `~/.aws/credentials` file. Alternatively you can inject the credentials via environment variables as described in
the configuration section

## Healthcheck

The endpoint `/healthcheck` checks the health of the dataset api and returns one of:

- success (200, JSON "status": "OK")
- failure (500, JSON "status": "error").
